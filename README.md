# DupinRecognitionAlgorithm
This repository contains files for interactive maple code to check whether an implicit equation of a Darboux cyclide is a Dupin cyclide or not. 
It also contains the computation of a Moebius invariant - extension of the torus invariant J0 = (1-r^2/R^2)*(r^2/R^2) - to general equation of Dupin cyclides - see https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14015.

HOW TO USE DupinRecognitionAlgorithm?

Step 1: You need to install Maple 2018 or a later version.

Step 2: Download the file "DupinRecognitionAlgorithm.txt" to your computer.

Step 3: Create a maple worksheet and save it to the same folder as the text file "DupinRecognitionAlgorithm.txt".

Step 4: Call the algorithm on the workseet as  read("./DupinRecognitionAlgorithm.txt");

Step 5: Enter your Darboux cyclide equation to investigate and apply the algorithm as shown in "example.txt".

Remark: After you dowload all the repository files in one folder, you may execute the maple file "read_example.mw".
